    How is this different than the normal Gym Env class?
    ====================================================

    Multi-agent Gym class is adapted from the main OpenAI single-agent Gym class.
    The main difference is that the reward is no longer required to be a single float but left
    as an arbitrary object to allow for the possibility of passing multiple rewards
    to multiple agents. Otherwise, this class is functionally exactly the same as the original gym
    Env class.

    Note that it is important to indicate which agents can act at each time step. This
    must be incorporated into the observation space. This can most naturally be done
    with a Tuple space.

    ====================================================

    It encapsulates an environment with arbitrary behind-the-scenes dynamics.
    An environment can be partially or fully observed.

    The main API methods that users of this class need to know are:

        step
        reset
        render
        close
        seed

    And set the following attributes:

        action_space: The Space object corresponding to valid actions
        observation_space: The Space object corresponding to valid observations
        reward_range: A tuple corresponding to the min and max possible rewards

    Note: a default reward range set to [-inf,+inf] already exists. Set it if you want a narrower range.

    The methods are accessed publicly as "step", "reset", etc.. The
    non-underscored versions are wrapper methods to which we may add
    functionality over time.

        The set of supported modes varies per environment. (And some

          return nothing. Usually for human consumption.
        - rgb_array: Return an numpy.ndarray with shape (x, y, 3),
          representing RGB values for an x-by-y pixel image, suitable
          for turning into a video.
        - ansi: Return a string (str) or StringIO.StringIO containing a
          terminal-style text representation. The text can include newlines
          and ANSI escape sequences (e.g. for colors).

        Note:
            Make sure that your class's metadata 'render.modes' key includes
              the list of supported modes. It's recommended to call super()
